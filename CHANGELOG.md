**Breaking release compared with v3.8.**

Some "invalid" `Point` methods have been removed:

- `Point`-`Real` arithmetic operations such as `Point(x, y) + n` are also no longer valid.

LaTeX support is still under development. See [JuliaGraphics/Cairo.jl#357](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Cairo.jl/pull/357).

- Removed some invalid `Point` methods (#294)
- `between` has more methods for ranges and arrays

### Removed
