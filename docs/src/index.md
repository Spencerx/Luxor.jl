    details: "Luxor provides lots of graphic primitives: lines, rectangles, circles, ellipses, arcs, polygons, Bézier curves, squircles, hypotrochoids, stars, crescents, pies, sectors, plus options for filling, stroking, clipping, and blending shapes. You can build up complex compositions using coordinate transformations (translation, rotation, and scaling) and Boolean operations."

The focus of Luxor is on simplicity and ease of use: it should be easier to use than plain [Cairo.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Cairo.jl), with shorter names, fewer underscores, default contexts, and simplified functions.

Luxor is thoroughly procedural and static: your code issues a sequence of simple graphics 'commands' until you've completed a drawing, then the results are saved into a PDF, PNG, SVG, or EPS file.

Here's a Luxor drawing showing some of the possibilities:

For more complex and sophisticated graphics in 2D and 3D, [Makie.jl](https://docs.makie.org/stable/) is the best choice.

There are some Luxor-related videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfd52kTA5JpzOEItSqXLQxg), and some Luxor-related blog posts at [cormullion.github.io/](https://cormullion.github.io/).

Luxor is designed primarily for drawing static pictures and simple animations. If you want to build complex or elaborate animations, use [Javis.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAnimators/Javis.jl) and [Makie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/).

Luxor isn't interactive: for building interactivity, look at [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) and [Makie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/).

Please submit issues and pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Luxor.jl). Original version by [cormullion](https://github.com/cormullion), much improved with contributions from the Julia community.

## Installation and basic usage

Install the package using the package manager:

```julia-repl
] add Luxor
```

To use Luxor, type:

```julia
using Luxor
```

To test:

```julia-repl
julia> @svg juliacircles()
```

or

```julia-repl
julia> @png juliacircles()
```

which should create a graphic file and possibly also display and/or open it, depending on your environment.

## Documentation

This documentation was built using [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs).

```@example
using Dates # hide
println("Documentation built $(Dates.now()) with Julia $(VERSION) on $(Sys.KERNEL)") # hide
